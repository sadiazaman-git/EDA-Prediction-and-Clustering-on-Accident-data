# Project Background & Aims

In this notebook, you will be using **Pandas** to read the dataset and to perform data analysis. We will
also be using **matplotlib** for data visualisation. The notebook will further expand your understanding of
**data preprocessing**, by implementing some of the key pre‑processing steps. 

We will be using **sklearn**
for using data mining and **machine learning (ML) algorithms**. The scikit‑learn or sklearn is an opensource
Machine Learning library available in Python for building effective and efficient models. It is built
on **NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib**. You will also be using NumPy library, which is for numeric
calculations. NumPy is n‑dimensional array, and it is used for Numerical Python, including basic linear
algebra functions, Fourier transforms, advanced random number capabilities.

**Questions to ask of this data -**

* combined with population data, how do different areas compare?
* what trends are there for accidents involving different road users eg motorcycles, peds, cyclists are road safety campaigns effective?
* likelihood of accidents for different groups / vehicles
## Recommendations & Conclusion

What recommendations can be made to government agencies based on this data and your analysis to improve safety? 

**Practical Applications:**
* Authorities and road safety organizations can use this information to target specific days for road safety campaigns, traffic management, and law enforcement.
* For instance, they can focus on promoting safe driving habits, conducting alcohol and speed checks, and improving road conditions on weekdays to reduce accident rates during these busy periods.
* Similarly, measures can be taken to ensure road safety during weekends when people might be more relaxed but still need to be cautious while driving.
* With such high performance, the model can be considered effective in predicting fatal injuries sustained in road traffic accidents. It can be valuable for informing and improving road safety measures, as it can accurately identify accidents with a higher risk of resulting in fatalities.
* However, it's still crucial to monitor the model's performance over time and continuously improve it as new data becomes available.

Additionally, collaborating with domain experts and stakeholders can provide valuable insights and help make data-driven decisions to enhance road safety measures further.
